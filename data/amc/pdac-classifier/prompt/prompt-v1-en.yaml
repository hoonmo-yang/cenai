    You are requested to categorize the clinical context category of CT report for
    a pancreatic cancer patient and to explain the reason behind your decision.
    Using the clinical context category descriptions and the searched context,
    determine which category the input CT report belongs to.
    Clearly justify your reasoning based on the category.

    *Category Descriptions*:
    For pancreatic cancer patients, imaging studies are categorized into the following four categories based on clinical context:

    Category 1. Initial diagnosis & staging:
      •	This category applies when a patient undergoes CT or MRI for the initial diagnosis of pancreatic cancer or for tumor
        staging when pancreatic cancer is suspected.
      •	This includes cases where CT or MRI is performed for a confirmed pancreatic cancer diagnosis and CT or MRI is performed for staging.
      •	In cases where a definitive diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is not confirmed, alternative differential diagnoses may be provided.
      •	CT or MRI interpretations focus on the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, the level of diagnostic certainty, possible differential diagnoses,
        tumor involvement of adjacent vessels and organs, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis (e.g., liver, peritoneal, or distant lymph nodes).
      Note:
      •	For patients referred from another hospital with a suspected or confirmed pancreatic cancer diagnosis,
        CT and MRI reports belonging to this clinical context category may include the change in tumor extent as well as tumor staging information.   
      •	This category does not include follow-up scans after surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, which fall
        under Category 2 (Follow-up for pancreatic cancer without curative resection) or Category 3 (Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer).

    Category 2. Follow-up for pancreatic cancer without curative resection:
      •	This category applies when CT or MRI is performed to monitor changes in unresected pancreatic cancer.
      •	This category refers to CT and MRI examinations performed in patients with pancreatic cancer who have not undergone curative resection, instead receiving chemotherapy,
        radiation, or conservative treatment, or being monitored without treatment.
      •	CT or MRI report contents focus on changes in primary pancreatic tumor extent (i.e., tumor size and extent of adjacent organ or blood vessel involvement),
        changes in existing metastasis, and new development of lymph node or distant metastasis. 
      Note:
      •	Patients who have undergone resection are not included in this category. Patients monitored for recurrence after resection are also excluded.

    Category 3. Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer:
      •	Applies to patients who have undergone pancreatic cancer surgery, with CT or MRI performed to assess for postoperative complications and recurrence.
      •	Imaging reports focus on the presence of absence of postoperative complications, local recurrence, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis.
        Patients with uncertain findings of recurrence may also be included.
      Note:
      •	This category includes initial recurrence cases after curative resection of pancreatic cancer but not subsequent follow-ups of known recurrences,
        which fall under Category 4 (Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection).

    Category 4. Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection:
      •	Applies when CT or MRI is performed to evaluate changes in a confirmed recurrence post-surgery, after treatment or observation.
      •	Recurrent tumors include local recurrences, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis (e.g., liver, peritoneal, lung metastasis).
      Note:
      •	This category includes cases with known recurred tumors post-resection, focusing on changes in existing lesions and the development of new lesions.
