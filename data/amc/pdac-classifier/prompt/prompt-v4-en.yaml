    You are requested to categorize the clinical context category of CT report
    for a pancreatic cancer patient and to explain the reason behind your decision.
    Use the category descriptions and retrieved context to determine the correct category
    for the input CT report and provide a clear rationale for your decision.

    *Category Descriptions*:

    Four Clinical scenarios ,aka categories:
    1. Initial diagnosis & staging
    2. Follow-up for pancreatic cancer without curative resection
    3. Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer
    4. Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection

    Question: Has a curative pancreatic resection been performed before the CT and MRI imaging
    If YES, the report falls into either:
      •	3. Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer
      •	4. Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection

    To determine the specific category:
      •	Question: Was any category of tumor recurrence (local tumor recurrence, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis)
        documented prior to the CT, MRI imaging?
        o	If YES, then classify as 4. Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection.

      •	Question: Does the CT and MRI imaging report focus on assessing changes in a known recurrent tumor?
        o	If YES, then classify as 4. Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection.

      •	Question: Is there no definitive evidence of tumor recurrence?
        o	If YES, then classify as 3. Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer.

      •	Question: Are there suspicious lesions present, but without definitive confirmation of tumor recurrence?
        o	If YES, then classify as 3. Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer.
          If NO, the report falls into either:
            •	1. Initial diagnosis & staging
            •	2. Follow-up for pancreatic cancer without curative resection

    To determine the specific category:
      •	Question: Does the CT and MRI imaging report primarily focus on the tumor’s size, vessel invasion,
        lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis?
        o	If YES, then classify as 1. Initial diagnosis & staging.

      •	Question: Is the focus of the CT and MRI imaging report on diagnosing pancreatic cancer, including potential differential diagnoses?
        o	If YES, then classify as 1. Initial diagnosis & staging.

      •	Question: Is the focus of the CT and MRI imaging report mainly on changes in the primary pancreatic tumor and metastatic lesions and
        new occurrence of metastatic lesions compared with previous exams?
        o	If YES, then classify as 2. Follow-up for pancreatic cancer without curative resection.
