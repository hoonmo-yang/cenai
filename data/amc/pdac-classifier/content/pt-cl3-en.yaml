    You are requested to categorize the clinical context category of CT report for
    a pancreatic cancer patient and to explain the reason behind your decision.
    Using the clinical context category descriptions and the searched context,
    determine which category the input CT report belongs to.
    Clearly justify your reasoning based on the category.

    *Category Descriptions*:
    For patients with pancreatic cancer, clinical situations where imaging tests are conducted during the diagnostic and treatment process are
    classified into the following four categories.

    A detailed description for each category is provided below.

    Category 1. Initial diagnosis & staging:

    This category includes situations where pancreatic cancer is first diagnosed when a patient visits the hospital for CT or MRI, or when the test is conducted
    to determine the stage in patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer.
    When the diagnosis is not strongly confirmed, differential diagnoses other than pancreatic cancer may be proposed.
    CT and MRI reports focus on diagnosis and potential differential diagnoses, tumor size, vascular or organ invasion, lymph node metastasis,
    and distant metastasis (e.g., liver, peritoneal, or distant lymph nodes).

    [Considerations for Classification]:
    Patients transferred from another hospital with suspected or confirmed pancreatic cancer fall under this category if they have not yet undergone surgery or chemotherapy.
    Patients who have already received treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or neoadjuvant therapy, do not fall under this category and should
    instead be classified under Category 2 (Follow-up for pancreatic cancer without curative resection) or Category 3 (Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer).

    Category 2. Follow-up for pancreatic cancer without curative resection:
    This category applies to patients who have not undergone curative resection after a pancreatic cancer diagnosis
    but are undergoing non-surgical treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation) or no treatment, followed by surveillance.
    CT and MRI reports primarily focus on changes in the tumor's size, the extent of organ or vascular invasion, new lymph node metastasis or
    distant metastasis, and alterations in pre-existing metastatic lesions.

    [Considerations for Classification]:
    Patients who have undergone resection for pancreatic cancer are not classified under this category.

    Category 3. Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer:
    This category applies to patients who have undergone curative resection for pancreatic cancer, where post-surgical imaging (CT or MRI) is conducted
    to check for complications or recurrence.
    Reports include information on abnormalities related to the surgery, local tumor recurrence, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis,
    as well as evaluations of any suspicious lesions.

    [Considerations for Classification]:
    Patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer recurrence for the first time through follow-up imaging after curative resection fall under this category.
    If the patient had been previously diagnosed with recurrence on prior imaging after curative resection, they should not be classified under this category.
    Patients who already had recurrent tumor or metastasis from a previous follow-up after curative resection and whose lesion status is being evaluated should
    fall under Category 4 (Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection).

    Category 4. Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection:
    This category applies to patients who, after undergoing curative resection for pancreatic cancer, have confirmed pancreatic cancer recurrence on previous imaging
    and are undergoing evaluation for changes in the recurrent tumor after chemotherapy, radiation, or conservative treatment.
    Pancreatic cancer recurrence includes newly occurring local recurrence, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis
    (e.g., liver, peritoneal, or lung metastasis).
    CT and MRI reports focus on the recurrent tumor's status and any newly detected recurrences.

    [Considerations for Classification]:
    Patients who have never undergone curative resection for pancreatic cancer do not fall under this category.
    Cases where suspicious lesions are being followed for possible recurrence after curative resection, but where recurrence is not yet confirmed,
    or cases where pancreatic cancer is newly diagnosed fall under Category 3 (Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer).
