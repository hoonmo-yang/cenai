  You are requested to predict the clinical context type of CT report
  for a pancreatic cancer patient and to explain the reason behind your decision.
  Use the type descriptions and retrieved context to determine the correct type
  for the input CT report and provide a clear rationale for your decision.

  *Type Descriptions*:

  Four Clinical scenarios ,aka types:
  Type 1. Initial diagnosis & staging:
  This type includes situations where pancreatic cancer is first diagnosed when a patient visits the hospital for CT or MRI,
  or when the test is conducted to determine the stage in patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer.
  When the diagnosis is not strongly confirmed, differential diagnoses other than pancreatic cancer may be proposed.
  CT and MRI reports focus on diagnosis and potential differential diagnoses, tumor size, vascular or organ invasion, lymph node metastasis,
  and distant metastasis (e.g., liver, peritoneal, or distant lymph nodes).

  Type 2. Follow-up for pancreatic cancer without curative resection:
  This type applies to patients who have not undergone curative resection after a pancreatic cancer diagnosis
  but are undergoing non-surgical treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation) or no treatment, followed by surveillance.
  CT and MRI reports primarily focus on changes in the tumor's size, the extent of organ or vascular invasion, new lymph node
  metastasis or distant metastasis, and alterations in pre-existing metastatic lesions.

  Type 3. Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer:
  This type applies to patients who have undergone curative resection for pancreatic cancer, where post-surgical
  imaging (CT or MRI) is conducted to check for complications or recurrence.
  Reports include information on abnormalities related to the surgery, local tumor recurrence, lymph node metastasis,
  and distant metastasis, as well as evaluations of any suspicious lesions.

  Type 4. Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection:
  This type applies to patients who, after undergoing curative resection for pancreatic cancer, have confirmed pancreatic cancer
  recurrence on previous imaging and are undergoing evaluation for changes in the recurrent tumor after chemotherapy, radiation,
  or conservative treatment.  Pancreatic cancer recurrence includes newly occurring local recurrence, lymph node metastasis,
  or distant metastasis (e.g., liver, peritoneal, or lung metastasis).
  CT and MRI reports focus on the recurrent tumor's status and any newly detected recurrences.

  Question: Has a curative pancreatic resection been performed before the CT and MRI imaging
  If YES, the report falls into either:
    •	3. Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer
    •	4. Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection

  To determine the specific type:
    •	Question: Was any type of tumor recurrence (local tumor recurrence, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis)
      documented prior to the CT, MRI imaging?
      o	If YES, then classify as 4. Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection.

    •	Question: Does the CT and MRI imaging report focus on assessing changes in a known recurrent tumor?
      o	If YES, then classify as 4. Follow-up for tumor recurrence after curative resection.

    •	Question: Is there no definitive evidence of tumor recurrence?
      o	If YES, then classify as 3. Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer.

    •	Question: Are there suspicious lesions present, but without definitive confirmation of tumor recurrence?
      o	If YES, then classify as 3. Follow-up after curative resection of pancreatic cancer.
        If NO, the report falls into either:
          •	1. Initial diagnosis & staging
          •	2. Follow-up for pancreatic cancer without curative resection

  To determine the specific type:
    •	Question: Does the CT and MRI imaging report primarily focus on the tumor’s size, vessel invasion,
      lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis?
      o	If YES, then classify as 1. Initial diagnosis & staging.

    •	Question: Is the focus of the CT and MRI imaging report on diagnosing pancreatic cancer, including potential differential diagnoses?
      o	If YES, then classify as 1. Initial diagnosis & staging.

    •	Question: Is the focus of the CT and MRI imaging report mainly on changes in the primary pancreatic tumor and metastatic lesions and
      new occurrence of metastatic lesions compared with previous exams?
      o	If YES, then classify as 2. Follow-up for pancreatic cancer without curative resection.
